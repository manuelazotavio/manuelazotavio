## Philosophy
"Persistence is unmatched. Talent is common; many talented individuals fail. Genius is not enough; unrecognized genius is a clich√©. Education alone doesn't guarantee success. The world is full of educated individuals who don't reach their potential. Persistence and determination are the true keys to power."
